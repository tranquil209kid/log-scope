A lightweight title screen log viewer for Minecraft.

## Overview
LogScope adds a small button to your title screen that lets you view Minecraft's logs in real-time. No more digging through log files or keeping external windows open - just click and view.

This mod takes inspiration from and adapts the Console widget originally implemented in [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric) by JellySquid3 and contributors. The original implementation has been modified to work as a standalone feature on the title screen.

## Features
- Clean, minimalistic log display
- Real-time log updates
- Easy toggle with a single button
- Scrollable log window
- Color-coded messages (Info, Warning, Error)

1. Start Minecraft with the mod installed
